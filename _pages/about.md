## <span style="color:#2F4F4F;">About Me</span>

I'm **<span style="color:#4682B4;">Anwar Hossain Zahid</span>**, a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Iowa State University**, advised by [<span style="color:#8B0000;">Professor Wei Le</span>](https://weile.work/).

My research lies at the intersection of **<span style="color:#008080;">Machine Learning</span>** and **<span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Software Engineering</span>**, with a focus on **debugging and reliability of ML systems**. Specifically, I work on developing **differential debugging frameworks for machine learning model versions** and techniques for **numerical stability analysis across platforms and compilers**.

Previously, I worked as a **Computing Graduate Intern at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc/parallel-systems-group)**, where I contributed to **testing GPU numerics across heterogeneous architectures (NVIDIA and AMD)**.

My research has resulted in publications at **top-tier venues like [ACM FSE](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmse)** and preprints addressing **numerical bugs in ML models, cross-GPU numerical inconsistencies, and evaluation of large language models for social good**.

Before starting my Ph.D., I accumulated **four years of industry experience** in **software engineering, integration, and R&D**, working on projects involving **ERP systems, AI-driven solutions, financial technology automation, and mobile platforms**.
