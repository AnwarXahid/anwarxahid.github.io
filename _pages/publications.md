## <span style="color:#4682B4;">Differential Debugging Framework for ML Model Versions</span>
**Duration:** *Fall 2023 – Present*  
**Supervisor:** [<span style="color:#8B0000;">Dr. Wei Le</span>](https://weile.work/)  
**Affiliation:** [Program Analysis & AI Lab](https://weile.work/lab.html), Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University

> Researching methods to **debug and analyze inconsistencies across different ML model versions** by leveraging **differential testing and invariant learning**. This work aims to detect regressions in reliability, fairness, and numerical stability introduced during model evolution.
